# Redmine

Redmine is a flexible project management web application written using Ruby on Rails framework.

More details can be found in the doc directory or on the official website http://www.redmine.org



An alternative for those who, like me, could not do deploy on Heroku, you can deploy your own copy of the app using this button:

[![Deploy on Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

- You can now log into your Redmine installation using the initial user account (username: `admin`,  password: `admin`).



## Current Versions:

- Redmine version                3.3.0.devel
- Ruby version                   2.2.4-p230 (2015-12-16) [x86_64-linux]
